**Biomedical Scientist | Neuroscience & Functional Genetics Expert | Postdoctoral Fellow at Northwestern University**  
**Neurodegenerative Disease & Pharmacogenetics Specialist**

I am passionate about neurodegenerative diseases, functional genetics, pharmacogenomics, and behavioral phenotyping using *C. elegans* as a model organism. I aim to understand how genetic variation influences disease and treatment outcomes by integrating high-throughput phenotyping with cutting-edge genomic approaches.

ðŸ”¬ Iâ€™m currently working on pharmacogenomics, GWAS, and functional modeling in *C. elegans*

## ðŸ§¬ Projects

**FarmacogenÃ³mica | GWAS**  
- Power analysis for genome-wide association studies using wild populations of *C. elegans*  
- Mapping genes involved in anthelmintic resistance using *C. elegans* through DWAS (drug-wide association studies)

**Functional Disease Modeling**  
- Behavioral data analysis of *C. elegans* mutants expressing human rare disease-associated gene variants

**Tierpsy Tracker**  
- **Tierpsy Tracker** is a multi-animal tracking tool developed by the MRC-LMS Behavioural Phenomics Lab at Imperial College London  
- Combines the throughput of multiworm tracking with single-worm resolution  
- Enables detailed phenotypic fingerprinting and analysis of collective behavior in animals such as worms, fish, and *Drosophila* larvae  
- The project is open-source and extensible: [Tierpsy Tracker GitHub](https://github.com/Tierpsy/tierpsy-tracker)
